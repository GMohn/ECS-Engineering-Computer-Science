## Learning Activities
- Lecture: 3.0 hours
- Discussion: 1.0 hours

## Description
ECS 150 is a course that provides an introduction to the basic concepts of operating systems and system programming. The course covers topics such as processes and interprocess communication/synchronization, virtual memory, program loading and linking, file and I/O subsystems, and utility programs. Students will also study a real operating system. The course may fulfill GE requirements for SciEng (prior to Fall 2011) and SE (starting Fall 2011)^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Prerequisites
To enroll in ECS 150, the following prerequisites are required:
- ECS 034 or ECS 036C or ECS 060
- ECS 154A or EEC 170^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Enrollment Restrictions
- Pass One is open to Computer Science Engineering and Computer Engineering Majors only.
- Pass Two is open to Computer Science Majors only^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.
