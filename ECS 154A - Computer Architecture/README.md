## Description
ECS 154A is an introductory course in digital design and computer architecture. The course covers topics such as combinational and sequential digital design, Boolean algebra, gates, commonly used MSI circuits, latches and flip-flops, finite state machine design, interrupts and interconnection hardware, memory types, and hardware support for operating systems software. The course also includes the use of simple digital design simulation software to aid in hierarchical system development^([source 5](https://github.com/SteveSun12138/Computer-Architecture))^.

## Prerequisites
To enroll in ECS 154A, the following prerequisites are required:
- ECS 050 or EEC 070^([source 5](https://github.com/SteveSun12138/Computer-Architecture))^.

## Credit Limitation
Only 1 unit of credit is allowed for students who have taken EEC 170^([source 5](https://github.com/SteveSun12138/Computer-Architecture))^.

## Enrollment Restrictions
ECS 154A is open to Computer Science and Computer Science Engineering majors only^([source 5](https://github.com/SteveSun12138/Computer-Architecture))^.

## Summary of Course Content
The ECS 154A course covers the following topics:

### Combinational and Sequential Digital Design
- Boolean algebra
- Gates
- Commonly used MSI circuits (e.g., multiplexers and decoders)
- Simple arithmetic circuits
- Latches and flip-flops
- Finite state machine design
- Use of simple digital design simulation software to aid in hierarchical system development

### Interrupts and Interconnection Hardware
- Hardware interrupts
- Synchronous and asynchronous buses
- Bus arbitration

### Memory
- Types of memory
- Decoding of system-level to chip-level addresses
- Caches and the memory hierarchy

### Hardware for Support of Operating Systems
- Hardware support to optimize resource usage
- Implementation of the abstraction of a separate machine for each user
- Design and use of memory-management hardware to support efficient and convenient OS memory allocation

The course also includes illustrative reading assignments from the books "Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface" by David Patterson and John Hennessy, and "Fundamentals of Digital Logic Custom" by Stephen Brown^([source 5](https://github.com/SteveSun12138/Computer-Architecture))^.
