I had trouble with plural and anagram in terms of whether I wanted to try to turn it into a pointer and manipulate like that or
use ascii key values to compare.

Also had trouble in pascal, wasn't really familiar with 2D arrays but after a couple hours learning it online I got the hang of it. 

My anagram programmed is still flawed but passed all the tests. It compares the characters with the same ones. eg boomb and bommb would be anagrams.
