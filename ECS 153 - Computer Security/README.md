## Description
ECS 153 is a course that focuses on the principles, mechanisms, and implementation of computer security and data protection. The course covers topics such as policy, encryption and authentication, access control, integrity models and mechanisms, network security, secure systems, programming and vulnerabilities analysis. Students will also study an existing operating system. The course is not open for credit to students who have completed ECS 155. It may fulfill GE requirements for SciEng (prior to Fall 2011) and SE (starting Fall 2011)^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Credit Limitation
ECS 153 is not open for credit to students who have completed ECS 155^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Enrollment Restrictions
Pass One is open to Computer Science and Computer Science Engineering Majors only^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Summary of Course Content
The ECS 153 course covers the following topics:

### What is computer security
- Notion of an informal policy
- Formalization of policy

### Encryption
- Classical encryption
- Public-key encryption
- Implementation and problems
- UNIX file encryption mechanism and its cryptanalysis
- The DES and RSA encryption algorithms

### Authentication
- Model of authentication systems
- Traditional passwords
- Challenge/response
- One-time passwords
- Cryptographic protocols
- Standard UNIX authentication system and its limits
- Implementations of other authentication mechanisms

### Access control
- Controlling access to resources
- Access matrix model
- Undecidability result
- Access control lists and capability lists
- Mandatory controls and originator controls
- Variants of access control
- UNIX access control scheme and augmentations

### Integrity
- Cryptographic checksums
- Malicious logic (viruses, Trojan horses)
- Defenses and prevention
- UNIX integrity checking tools and how they work
- Malicious logic in UNIX environments

### Security-oriented programming
- Design principles
- Common problems
- Gates vs. privileged servers
- Environment and exception handling
- Writing secure servers and setuid/setgid programs in the UNIX environment

### Networks and security
- Internet Security Architecture
- Analysis of Internet protocols
- Design and implementation considerations
- Firewalls
- UNIX networking and security

### Penetration analysis
- Common types of flaws
- Examples
- Flaw hypothesis methodology
- Analysis of programs and systems
- UNIX instances of problems, flaws, and how to fix them

### Secure systems
- Types, models, design
- Changes to non-secure systems
- Comparative analysis

The course also includes a laboratory project where students will build a tool to analyze and/or improve the security of a computer or installation running the UNIX operating system or using the Internet. The project involves selecting a goal, measuring success or failure, designing the software, implementing it under the UNIX operating system, and analyzing its effectiveness^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.
