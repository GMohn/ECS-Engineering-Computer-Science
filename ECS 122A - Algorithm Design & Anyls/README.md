## Description
ECS 122A is a course that focuses on the complexity analysis, design, and analysis of algorithms. The course covers topics such as searching, sorting, pattern matching, graph algorithms, and approximation methods. It also introduces algorithm design techniques including divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming. Additionally, the course explores NP-complete problems and the bounds on algorithm complexity. ECS 122A may fulfill GE requirements for SciEng and SE^([source 0](https://cs.sf.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-122a-algorithm-design-and-analysis))^.
