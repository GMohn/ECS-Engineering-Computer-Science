## Description
ECS 171 is an introductory course in Machine Learning (ML) that provides students with a comprehensive understanding of ML methods and learning theory. The course covers both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, including classification, dimensionality reduction, regression, and clustering using modern ML methods. It also explores the applications of ML in various fields. The course involves problem sets and a term project that focuses on applying ML methods in different scientific domains^([source 12](https://www.ucdavis.edu/)).
