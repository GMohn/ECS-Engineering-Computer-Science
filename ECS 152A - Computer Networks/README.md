## Description
ECS 152A is a course that provides an overview of computer networks. The course covers topics such as the TCP/IP protocol suite, computer-networking applications and protocols, transport-layer protocols, network architectures, Internet Protocol (IP), routing, link-layer protocols, local area and wireless networks, medium access control, physical aspects of data transmission, and network-performance analysis. Students who have already taken ECS 157 will receive only 2 units of credit for this course. The course may fulfill GE requirements for SciEng (prior to Fall 2011) and SE (starting Fall 2011)^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Prerequisites
To enroll in ECS 152A, the following prerequisites are required:
- ECS 060 or ECS 032B or ECS 036C
- ECS 132 or EEC 161 or MAT 135A or STA 131A or STA 120 or STA 032^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Credit Limitation
Students who have taken ECS 157 will receive only 2 units of credit for ECS 152A^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Enrollment Restrictions
- Pass One is open to Computer Science and Computer Science Engineering Majors only.
- Cross Listing(s): Same course as EEC 173A^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Summary of Course Content
The ECS 152A course covers the following topics:

### Introduction
- Terminology
- TCP/IP protocol suite
- Layered architecture, protocols, and standards

### Networking Applications and Protocols
- Distributed applications
- Application layer protocols
- Introduction to network programming

### Transport Layer Protocols
- Transport layer services
- Reliable transport protocols
- Introduction to TCP and UDP

### Network Layer Protocols
- Packet switching
- Circuit switching
- Virtual circuit vs. datagram
- Statistical multiplexing
- Routing

### Link Layer Protocols
- Flow control
- Error detection and control
- Broadcast Communication Networks

### Local Area Networks (LANs)
- Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols
- Channel Partitioning: FDMA, TDMA, CDMA
- Random Access: ALOHA, CSMA/CD
- Controlled Access: Token ring/bus
- LAN technologies and topologies

### Wireless Networks
- Physical Layer Aspects of Data Transmission
- Signals, spectral analysis, bandwidth
- Transmission impairments
- Data encoding/decoding
- Communication Techniques

### Network Performance Analysis
- Simple queuing models and simulation analysis
- Network measurement tools
- Analysis of protocols

The course also includes a series of design projects to reinforce concepts and familiarize students with network measurement tools and simulators used in protocol analysis. Example projects may involve designing a simulation model to compare the performance of different medium access control protocols, monitoring and analyzing network data using network measurement tools or a LAN analyzer, designing measurement experiments to analyze specific performance metrics or network anomalies, and implementing a simple client-server application^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.
