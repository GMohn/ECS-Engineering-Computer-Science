## Description
ECS 050 is a course that focuses on the comparative study of different hardware architectures through programming in the assembly languages of various machines. The course also explores the role of system software in producing an abstract machine and introduces I/O devices and programming. It is important to note that students who have taken EEC 070 are only allowed to receive 1 unit of credit for this course. This course may fulfill GE requirements for SciEng and SE^([source 0](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-050-computer-organization-machine-dependent-programming))^.

## Prerequisites
- ECS 040 C- or better or ECS 034 C- or better or ECS 036B C- or better^([source 0](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-050-computer-organization-machine-dependent-programming))^.

## Credit Limitation
Only 1 unit of credit is allowed for students who have taken EEC 070^([source 0](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-050-computer-organization-machine-dependent-programming))^.

## Summary of Course Content
The ECS 050 course covers the following topics:

### Basic Memory Architecture
- Review of ECS 040 C-language material on bits, bytes, and memory addresses.
- Linear versus segmented address forms.

### Introduction to Processor Architecture
- Introduction to instruction sets, addressing modes, and register sets, and their variation from one machine to another.
- Comparison of at least one CISC architecture and at least one RISC architecture through extensive assembly-language programming on each.
- Memory-mapped versus separate-address-space I/O.
- I/O devices.
- Hardware interrupts.
- I/O programming approaches: wait-loop, interrupt-driven, and via calls to operating system services or keyboard, video, and file access.

### The Role of System Software in Producing an Abstract Machine
- Distinction between the roles of hardware and software.
- The use of compilers and operating systems in providing abstractions and machine independence to the programmer.
- Compiler implementation of C/Pascal data types and storage allocation of variables in memory.
- The role of the operating system in helping the programmer create, store, and execute programs, as well as managing system resources.

### Machine Capability and Speed
- Transportability/non-transportability of programs on different machines, operating systems, and compilers.
- Efficiency of compiled vs. hand-coded programs.
- Writing mixed C-language/assembly language programs for extra efficiency or special capabilities.
- Tradeoffs between the speed of hardware implementation of a function and the flexibility of software implementation^([source 0](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-050-computer-organization-machine-dependent-programming))^.

## Goals
By taking ECS 050, students will:
1. Learn fundamental concepts of computer architecture.
2. Learn fundamental concepts of software systems.
3. Be able to write programs in assembly language for at least two different architectures^([source 0](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-050-computer-organization-machine-dependent-programming))^.
