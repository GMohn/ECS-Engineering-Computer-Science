## Status
Active

## Units
4.0

## Effective Term
2019 Fall Quarter

## Learning Activities
- Lecture: 3.0 hours
- Discussion: 1.0 hours

## Description
ECS 140A is a course that focuses on the syntactic definition of programming languages and introduces various programming language features. The course covers topics such as variables, data types, data abstraction, object-orientedness, scoping, parameter disciplines, and exception handling. It also provides a comparative study of several high-level programming languages. The course may fulfill GE requirements for SciEng (prior to Fall 2011) and SE (starting Fall 2011)^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Prerequisites
To enroll in ECS 140A, the following prerequisites are required:
- ECS 050
- ECS 034 or ECS 036C

- ECS 150 (recommended)^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Enrollment Restrictions
Pass One is open to Computer Science and Computer Science Engineering Majors only^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Goals
By taking ECS 140A, students will:
1. Understand the syntactic definition of programming languages.
2. Learn about programming language features such as variables, data types, and data abstraction.
3. Gain knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts and scoping.
4. Explore non-imperative programming paradigms.
5. Compare and analyze different high-level programming languages.
