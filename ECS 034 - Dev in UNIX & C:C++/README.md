## Summary of Course Content
The ECS 034 course covers the following topics:

### The UNIX Environment
- Review of basic UNIX environment concepts, such as processes/job control, file system, and utilities.
- Shell scripts.

### Software Engineering & Tools
- Debugging techniques using aids such as gdb/ddd.
- Review of software engineering tools like make, git, etc.
- Unit Testing using frameworks like Google Test.
- Program development using third-party libraries.
- Other tools like IDEs, ssh clients, linters, etc.

### Programming in C
- Syntax differences between C and other languages, including Python.
- Data structures: single and multidimensional arrays, character strings, and structs.
- Use of system files such as library and "include" files.
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
- Function pointers and inversion of control.

### Object-Oriented Programming in C++
- Object-oriented design and implementation, polymorphism, operator overloading, encapsulation, and derivation.
- Modular programming: programs composed of multiple C++ files and headers, overview of the compilation/linking sequence.
- Pointer manipulation, including dynamic memory allocation.
- Implementation of data structures like trees and graphs.
- Templates and the Standard Template Library.
- Modern C++ features like C++11, C++14, C++17, etc.

### Analysis of Graph Algorithms
- Critical path analysis, depth-first search, shortest path, minimum spanning tree, and network flow^([source 0](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-034-software-development-unix-cc))^.
