# ECS 032B - Introduction to Data Structures

## Course Description
Design and analysis of data structures using Python; trees, heaps, searching, sorting, and graphs. No credit to students who completed ECS 036B, ECS 036C, ECS 040, or ECS 060. GE Prior to Fall 2011: SciEng. GE: SE.

## Prerequisites
ECS 010 C- or better or ECS 030 C- or better or ECS 032A C- or better or ECS 036A C- or better

## Course Content
- Recursion
- Theory: Complexity, algorithm analysis
- Abstract Data Types
  - Stacks, queues, lists, trees, balanced binary search trees, priority queues, graphs
- Analysis of Sorting Algorithms
  - Insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, bucket sort, and radix sort

## Goals
Students will:
- Learn to think clearly about and solve complex and poorly-defined programming tasks
- Be able to:
  - Find appropriate abstractions to solve a complex problem
  - Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms
  - Analyze simple algorithms and discuss tradeoffs among data structures
  - Get it all working
