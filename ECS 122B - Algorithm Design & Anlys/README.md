- Discussion: 1.0 hours

## Description
ECS 122B is a course that builds upon the concepts learned in ECS 122A. It focuses on the theory and practice of hard problems and problems with complex algorithm solutions. The course covers topics such as NP-completeness, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, dynamic programming, and branch and bound. Students will learn theoretical analysis, implementation, and practical evaluations of these algorithms. Examples from parallel, string, graph, and geometric algorithms will be explored. The course also emphasizes the use of timing and profiling tools to evaluate algorithm performance^([source 3](https://catalog.ucdavis.edu/courses-subject-code/ecs/))^.

## Prerequisites
