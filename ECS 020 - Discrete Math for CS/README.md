## Description
ECS 020 is a course that covers discrete mathematics topics relevant to computer science. The course focuses on developing fundamental ideas and techniques from discrete mathematics and applying them to computer science. Topics covered include proofs by induction, propositional and first-order logic, sets, functions, and relations, big-O notation, recursion and solutions of recurrence relations, combinatorics, probability on finite probability spaces, and graph theory. The course aims to improve students' ability to write concise and rigorous proofs, understand mathematical definitions and proofs, and enhance their general mathematical sophistication^([source 6](https://cs.sf.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-020-discrete-mathematics-computer-science)).
